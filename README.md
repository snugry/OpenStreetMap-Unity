# How:
1. Download map data (.osm file) from [this web site](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
2. Put the .osm file in Assets/OSM/Data/ Folder (important)
3. In SampleScene, Find the component <MapController> atacched to gameobject "OSMmap", change its OSMfileName value. If you named your .osm file as "name.osm", you shoude enter "name.osm". 



# Now:
1. Show Roads
2. Show Buildings
3. Show Parks
